Insight: This part necessitates providing any necessary background or contextual information. The more relevant details ChatGPT receives, the more accurately and appropriately it can respond.

Statement: This element is the core of your prompt: What are you asking ChatGPT to do? The more specific you are, the more precise the response.

Personality: How do you want ChatGPT to come across in its response? Should it be formal and business-like or casual and friendly? This component can help lend a personal touch to your interaction.

Experiment: This component encourages you to ask ChatGPT to provide multiple responses or examples, enabling you to choose the best one or combine elements from several options.

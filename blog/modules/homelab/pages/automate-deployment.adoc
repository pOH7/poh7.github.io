= Automate Deployment in Homelab

== Background
My homelab is a bare Debian system running single node k3s (Lightweight Kubernetes)

.version dependencies
[plantuml,scale=0.5,svg]
----
object "[[https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/ flux]]" as flux {
  version: 2.3.0
}
object "[[https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/ istio]]" as istio {
  version: 1.22.1
}
object "[[https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/ cert-manager]]" as certmanager {
  version: 1.15
}
object "[[https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases k3s]]" as k3s {
  version: 1.30.1+k3s1
}
object "[[https://github.com/cert-manager/istio-csr cert-manager/istio-csr]]" as csr {
  version: 0.9.0
}
flux --> k3s
istio --> k3s
certmanager --> k3s
csr --> istio
csr --> certmanager
----

flux, istio, cert-manager and (of course!) k3s are manually managed

== Automate Deployment
I use a GitHub private repository to store my kubernetes manifests and flux to apply them to the k3s cluster

----
!include <C4/C4_Container>
System(flux, "Flux", "Continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes")
System(github, "GitHub", "Git repository")
System(k3s, "k3s", "Lightweight Kubernetes")
System_Ext(cr, "Container Registry", "Docker image registry")

Rel(flux, k3s, "Apply manifest to")
Rel_R(flux, github, "Checkout manifests from")
Rel_R(k3s, cr, "Pull image from")
----

Due to some network issues, I also use Alibaba Cloud Container Registry to store some public images, so my k3s cluster can pull them from there faster
[plantuml,scale=0.5,svg]
----
!include <C4/C4_Container>
System(github, "GitHub", "Git repository")
System(github_runner, "GitHub Runner", "Check latest image")
System(acr, "Alibaba Cloud Container Registry", "Docker image registry")
System_Ext(cr, "Docker Hub / GitHub Packages / etc.", "Docker image registry")

Rel_R(github_runner, github, "Get task from")
Rel(github_runner, acr, "Push image to")
Rel_L(github_runner, cr, "Pull image from")
----
// Rel_R(github_runner, github, "Store result to")

I also use flux to automate update image version in my kubernetes manifests, then I can keep my applications up to date

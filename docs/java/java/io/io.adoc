== Blocking IO - java.io

[NOTE]
I/O must be properly buffered for files and sockets, and also for internal operations like compression and string encoding

== Non-Blocking IO - java.nio

Channel::
A channel represents an open connection to an entity such as a hardware device, a file, a network socket, or a program component that is capable of performing one or more distinct I/O operations, for example reading or writing.

. SocketChannel
. ServerSocketChannel
. FileChannel

Buffer::
A container for data of a specific primitive type.

. ByteBuffer

Selector::
Selector is a class which implements readiness notification.
Based on system call `select` or `epoll`

. read readiness
. write readiness
. accept readiness

== I/O Models

. blocking I/O
. nonblocking I/O
. I/O multiplexing (select and poll)
. signal driven I/O (SIGIO)
. asynchronous I/O (the POSIX aio_functions)
